# ladbrokes
Ladbrokes Test
For this, I have used a MySQL database.  I have included a file to setup the database (including sample data).  REplace the details in the database_login.php file with connection details to your own MySQL database.
I have assumed that competitors should be listed in position order.
The countdown is done from the server side rather than on the client side.  A reload of the data from the server side is done every second to be sure that a race 'disappears' when the closing time clicks over.
